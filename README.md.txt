# Data Science Assignment – Web3 Trading Team  
## Candidate: Prajakta  

This repository contains my submission for the Data Science assignment focused on analyzing how trader behavior aligns with overall market sentiment (Fear vs Greed).  
The assignment uses two datasets:  
1. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset  
2. Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid
